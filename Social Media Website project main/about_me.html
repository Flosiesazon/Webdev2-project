                  Hi, my name is Flosie Sazon. I am a 19 years old Creative Digital Media student in Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin) located in Blanchardstown Campus. I was born in the Philippines and moved to Ireland in 2013 to continue my studies.
               </p>
               <p class="par">
                  I created this website especially for students and teachers that are not familiar with different social media tools that they can use for education. This website has 5 different applications that you might decide to use after reading the different types of information I gathered such as their basic information, instructions on how to use the App with a video and also its cautions and safety. I hope you find my website helpful and If you want to share your opinions or you have more questions, feel free to ask me by signing up an application form in the contact page!
