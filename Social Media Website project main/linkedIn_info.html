               When you first visit the website and sign up, you are asked to create your profile. This includes your full name, email and a secure password. They will also give you an option of signing up with your Facebook account. Once you read and agree with the User Agreement, Private Policy and Cookie Policy, your account will be created.

               Then they will give you a selection to identify yourself and you will select “I’m a student” and click yes. You will also have to enter some specific information about you such as the College/University you go to, your degree/specialization, what year you started and the year you will be expected to graduate.
            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, after you finished creating your account, they will suggest you download their App which is free and available on IOS and Android devices. The application allows you to check updates and apply for jobs all on your phone.

            <p>The first task in creating your profile is to add your image to help other people such as managers to check and identify who are they trying to hire. You can also add your past occupations to help companies see the skills you have learned that you can give them, and you add your background information e.g. your college and course.
            </p>
            <p>To see specific jobs, there is a “#” you can follow and check. When the job is available it will show up on your newsfeed. You can also look at the jobs in the search bar and all the jobs that are available will appear.

            <p>By introducing  LinkedIn to first year students, it will expose them to the workforce where they can build themselves as they use the skills, they develop through their course in various projects inside and outside  third level institutions. Through LinkedIn, they can follow the example of renowned and established professionals and strive for their own ambitions and goals.  - JRL

            <b class="par">Be trustworthy</b>
            <p class="par">Our members must be honest people, who provide their real name and accurate information about themselves. We don’t allow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/helping-you-report-inappropriate-behavior-how-to-videos-madhu-gupta/" class="text-decoration2">fabricated profiles</a> on our platform and it’s not okay to provide misleading or deceptive information about yourself, your qualifications, work experience, affiliations, or achievements. The purpose of LinkedIn is to provide accurate and professional information to other professionals, creating fake profiles jeopardizes this. This is understandably the first term and condition.</p>
         </div>
            <div class="col-19">
               <h3 class="middle">Be Safe</h3>
               <p class="par">We strive to maintain a civil and friendly community for our members. The services shouldn't be used to harm others or their careers or business prospects or to air personal grievances and disputes. It is not okay to harass, abuse, or send other unwelcome communications to people (e.g., romantic advances, sexually explicit content, junk mail, spam, chain letters, phishing schemes). We do not allow hate speech, hate groups, terrorists, or those who engage in violent crimes on the services. </p>
               <p class="par">We are living in the #metoo era as well as the age of trolling and cyberbullying where there is increased pressure on social media platforms to police harassment and hate speech and LinkedIn is no acceptation.
               This provision shows that LinkedIn is a safe platform for its users. We will now look at the consequences for violations.
