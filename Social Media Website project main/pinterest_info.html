            Pinterest was founded in 2009 and only really started to kick off in 2012 when it hit 11.7 million users followed by 25 million later in the year. This made it the fastest ever to break the 10m mark. A year later it hit 70m and continued to rise after his. Pinterest is great for so many different reasons including brand advertising as it has a huge audience. In one case study done of a fashion website, users visiting Pinterest spent 185 dollars compared to users coming from Facebook spending 85 dollars. Pinterest has become more and more popular throughout the last 11 years valuing at 12 billion in 2017.

         <h3>Getting Ideas</h3>
         <p class="par2">
            The best way to use Pinterest for educational purposes would be for getting ideas from the visuals on Pinterest for project-based learning and getting ideas from. Going onto Pinterest and pinning suitable material makes it much easier for the student and the teacher

         <h3>Organizing your Ideas</h3>

            Pinterest is a great way of keeping your ideas organized by putting them into folders and labelling them. This makes them easy to find and view very quickly
         </p>
         <h3> Promoting</h3>

            Pinterest is a great way to show off your work by posting it. If you think it is worth sharing, others may think it is worth pinning.

               When searching about the cautions about the app I could not really find any apart from articles about Plagiarism and copyright claims. People often "pin" images that are linked directly to the site and although a lot of artist are ok with this some are not. With a lot of them clamping down on the unlicensed use of their image. It also does not help that you Pinterest account is your full name and can be linked to you Google or Facebook account making it easier for them to find out who you are. But it is very rare that the copyright claim is given to the users. Pinterest is more likely to face Copyright claims than its users.

               Pinterest is an app for ages 12+ and can sometimes you can find content on the app that could be triggering. Pinterest moderates all its content but when moderating certain word, they cannot locate all of it. One word they recently moderated was "anti-vaccination" but were only able to clear up 88 percent of that content meaning that some of it was still on the app. When someone flags a post, it removes the post three times faster than if the post was found by Pinterest themselves so when coming across content that you don’t enjoy or like its best to flag it
