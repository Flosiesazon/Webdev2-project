               Slack is a type of instant messaging platform, like WhatsApp, Snapchat and Messenger, developed by Slack Technologies. It is meant to help people and their teams work together more seamlessly. It was designed this way in order to help support the way people naturally work together, so that they can collaborate with other people online as efficiently as you do face-to-face. The main part of Slack is called the workspace, which is made of different channels, each belonging to a different team member where they communicate and talk to each other as well as send messages and share files. You’re even able open private chats between you and your team and start a voice messages or video call. The messages are almost instant so not only can you talk to one another but have full blown conversations.

               There are many ways for a teacher /lecturer utilize social media in order to assist them teach with teaching their class. For instance, social media gives lecturers a chance to post homework online when they are unable to do so in class. It also allows the college to communicate to students and their families about upcoming events. Social is also very helpful in helping students engage further with the lecture materials.
            </p>
            <p class="par">
               A student can easily send a lecturer an email about an issue, instead of having to meet them face to face. It is more convenient than having to arrange a meeting a later time and having to wait days for an appointment since the lecturer can easily send a response within minutes of receiving an email. Lecturers can also upload lecture videos in Slack for people who were unable to attend lectures. Monitoring a student progress is also something social media is very useful for a prime example of this is Moodle.

            <p class="par">As a mentioned, Slack can also be used for things other than study groups as it gives the lecturer a chance to interact with students outside of school, giving the students access to the most up to date information about work and events, for example the date when the grades are going to be released.</p>
            <p class="par">One way that Slack can be used for teaching is through the creation of study groups when making groups assignments. This way, groups can communicate and help each other in the comfort of their own homes. They can easily send files and emails to each other, exchange ideas and get feedback from group members. Since communication in Slack is instant, you don’t have to worry about any lags.</p>

          <!--How it can be misused-->
         <div class="item-16">
            <h3 class="caution-safety">How it can be misused:</h3>
            <p>
               Slack provides services for all users called ‘Channels’. Channels allows you to communicate to any person or a group through a hashtag set up by an admin. When you join the hashtag, you will become a part of the group channel. For example, #businessclub. In regard to these ‘channels’, they can sometimes become more of an immature group chat rather than a professional outlet where groups of people can share their files, emails or notes.
            </p>
         </div>
           <div class="item-17">
            <h3 class="caution-safety">Trolling/Bullying</h3>
            <p>
               Linking in with the use of ‘channels’, bullying can happen as when joining groups with people who have the same interests, but different outlooks can cause conflicts. There is not a lot of bullying documented on the app which is a positive thing.
            </p>
            <p>
               As slack was created for people to work together to communicate, unfortunately it doesn’t allow you to block, mute or report people. This reason being the app wants you to work together to solve the issue as if you were on a team.
